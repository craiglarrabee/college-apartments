Yes, for the sum of $150.00 over your semester rent for students with two in a room or small private rooms and $300.00 per semester for students that have a private suite. At the time you enter into a lease agreement, we will include your utility charge as part of the rent. Your landlord pays for high speed Internet and garbage collection as part of the rent. For the $150.00 ($300.00 for private suite) your landlord pays for gas, electric, sewer, garbage collection and water. If your apartment utilities goes over the $900.00 per semester (very few do), you and your roommates will be responsible for the overage. The advantages for your landlord paying your utilities are you don\"t have to collect from each other, no one has to put a deposit up with the utility company and be responsible to the utility company, and you don\"t have to transfer the utilities into your own name and get them turned on. Landlord pays for WiFi, sewer, water, gas, and garbage collection.

It is due on December 1st for Spring semester. Students can pay in installments if they and their parents live in the State of Utah and if their parents sign a guaranty and credit card authorization agreement for the rent. There is a $50 per semester charge for those paying in installments. Those that pay with installments are required to pay 1/3rd of the semester\"s rent plus the $50 per semester charge for those paying in installments on August 1st for Fall semester or move in date, whichever comes first, 1/3rd on September 1st, and 1/3rd on October 1st. For Spring semester 1/3rd of the semester\"s rent plus the $50 per semester charge is due Dec 1st, 1/3 January 1st, and the balance is due on Feb 1st. For those with<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>scholarships</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>or financial aid covering rent we realize most scholarships or financial aid packages are not funded until about a month into the semester. In such cases you need your parents to sign a guaranty and credit card authorization agreement (for scholarships and financial aid this is ok even for out of state students but not for students who live outside of the United States) and you need to provide written confirmation from SUU of the scholarship or financial aid. Once this information is given then those with scholarships or financial aid pay as follows: Fall semester: 1/3rd of the semester\"s rent is due on August 10th or upon move-in whichever comes first and the balance is due one month from the first day of Fall Semester or the day the scholarship or financial aid is received whichever comes first. Spring semester: 1/3 of the semester\"s rent is due on December 1st and the balance is due one month from the beginning of Spring semester or the day the scholarship or financial aid is received whichever comes first. If your scholarship or financial aid is not here within 30 days from the start of the semester, or if we cannot confirm with the school that it will be here soon thereafter, then we treat you like a student paying “monthly” (see above) until the scholarship funds arrive to pay the balance of your rent.</span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: medium; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;\"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p><br></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: medium; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;\">3.<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Does my deposit go towards my rent?</strong><span>&nbsp; No. The deposit is used as security for any damages caused or cleaning that is not taken care of at the end of the lease. A non-refundable sum of $100.00 is deducted for carpet cleaning, window cleaning, fixing all holes in the wall of a reasonable size from hanging picture frames, and touch up painting which is done each year after the students leave. An extra $25.00 is deducted for your landlord handling the paperwork of paying your utilities (Landlord keeps track of each apartment for all the utilities, and if applicable bills tenants for overages each semester). The rest of the deposit, less unpaid amounts under the lease, damages, and cleaning fees, if any, will be mailed back to you.</span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;

To figure out the amount per day simply take the semester rent, for your room type and divide it by 121. For example if your semester rent is $2,000.00 then prorated daily early move in rent is $2,000.00/121 = $16.53 per day.

Spring Semester: the semester\"s utility charges plus one-third of the net semester’s rent, plus the $50.00 fee will be due December 1st, and the balance will be due one month from the first day of the Spring semester or on the day the financial aid is received if earlier</p><p>Late fees: A late fee of $50.00 plus $5.00 per day up to a total of $100.00 shall be assessed to delinquent accounts.
